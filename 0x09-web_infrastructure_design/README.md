# WEB SERVER
The primary role of a web server is to receive and fulfill client requests for static content from a website, such as HTML pages, files, images, and videos. Typically, the client is a browser or mobile application, and the requests and responses are exchanged using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
# APPLICATION SERVER
On the other hand, an application server's main purpose is to provide clients with access to what is commonly known as "business logic," which generates dynamic content. This business logic involves code that manipulates data to deliver specialized functionality specific to a business, service, or application. The clients of an application server often include other applications, as well as web servers and other application servers. While communication between the application server and clients can utilize HTTP messages, it is not a mandatory requirement as it is for web servers and their clients. Various other protocols, including different CGI variants, are commonly used for this purpose.
